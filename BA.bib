	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack poses a severe threat to the Internet. It is difficult to find the exact signature of attacking. Moreover, it is hard to distinguish the difference of an unusual high volume of traffic which is caused by the attack or occurs when a huge number of users occasionally access the target machine at the same time. The entropy detection method is an effective method to detect the DDoS attack. It is mainly used to calculate the distribution randomness of some attributes in the network packets' headers. In this paper, we focus on the detection technology of DDoS attack. We improve the previous entropy detection algorithm, and propose two enhanced detection methods based on cumulative entropy and time, respectively. Experiment results show that these methods could lead to more accurate and effective DDoS detection.},

With the rapid development of computer and communication technology, the harm of DDoS attack is becoming more and more serious. Therefore, the research on DDoS attack detection becomes more important. Nowadays, some related research work has been done and some progress has been made. However, due to the diversity of DDoS attack modes and the variable size of attack traffic, there has not yet been a detection method with satisfactory detection accuracy at present. In view of this, this paper proposes a DDoS attack detection method based on machine learning, which includes two steps: feature extraction and model detection. In the feature extraction stage, the DDoS attack traffic characteristics with a large proportion are extracted by comparing the data packages classified according to rules. In the model detection stage, the extracted features are used as input features of machine learning, and the random forest algorithm is used to train the attack detection model. The experimental results show that the proposed DDoS attack detection method based on machine learning has a good detection rate for the current popular DDoS attack.},

DDoS attacks come in a variety of types and schemes, they continue to evolve, steadily becoming more sophisticated and larger at scale. A close investigation of attack vectors and refining current security measures is required to efficiently mitigate new DDoS threats. The solution described in this article concerns a less explored variation of signature-based techniques for DDoS mitigation. The approach exploits one of the traits of modern DDoS attacks, the utilization of Packet generation algorithms (PGA) in the attack execution.

Since the nature of such anomalies may be different for different types of attacks, detection of these is not trivial and may require specific anomaly detection techniques. In this work, we focus on anomaly or outlier detection techniques for DDoS attacks on computer networks. Our main goal is to find such techniques that prove most appropriate for different types of attacks. We restrict our research to fully unsupervised methods, because, in real world scenarios, it is difficult to obtain examples of all possible anomalies, especially that the set of those is constantly growing. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first that utilizes time-related features in a purely unsupervised manner and that provides a fair comparison between widely known outlier detection methods. We evaluate clustering, autoencoder and LSTM-based techniques on commonly used datasets, i.e. DARPA1998, ISCXIDS2012, CICDDOS2019. Moreover, we propose IQRPACF method that combines IQR with partial autocorrelation function. The proposed method not only does not require to be trained, but also, in most cases, outperforms the other solutions.},

Recently, research on DDoS attacks detection in SDN has focused on investigation of how to leverage data plane programmability, enabled by P4 language, to detect attacks directly in network switches, with marginal involvement of SDN controllers. In order to effectively address cybersecurity management in SDN architectures, we investigate the potential of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to perform automated DDoS Attacks Detection (DAD), specifically focusing on Transmission Control Protocol SYN flood attacks. We compare two different DAD architectures, called Standalone and Correlated DAD, where traffic features collection and attack detection are performed locally at network switches or in a single entity (e.g., in SDN controller), respectively. We combine the capability of ML and P4-enabled data planes to implement real-time DAD. Illustrative numerical results show that, for all tested ML algorithms, accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are above 98\% in most cases, and classification time is in the order of few hundreds of \$\${\textbackslash}upmu {\textbackslash}text \{s\}\$\$in the worst case. Considering real-time DAD implementation, significant latency reduction is obtained when features are extracted at the data plane by using P4 language.},

	abstract = {The survivability of the future Internet is largely dependent on whether it will be able to successfully address both security and performance issues facing the Internet. On one hand, the Internet becomes more and more vulnerable due to fast spreading malicious attacks. On the other hand, it is under great stress to meet ever growing/changing application demands while having to sustain multi-gigabit forwarding performance. In this paper, we propose a Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) coprocessor based solution for high speed, integrated TCP flow anomaly detection and policy filtering. The attacking packets with spoofed source IP addresses are detected through two-dimensional (2D) matching. The key features of the solution are: (1) setting flag bits in TCAM action code to support various packet treatments; (2) managing TCP flow state in pair to do 2D matching. We evaluate the solution’s ability to detect TCP-based flooding attacks based on real-world-trace simulations. The results show that the proposed solution can match up OC-192 line rate. The possible modifications of the solution for the detection of low rate TCP-targeted attacks are also discussed.},

States that packet and flow classification, needed to support differential services can create potential bottlenecks for high speed forwarding. Here TCAM is used as a packet classifier for policy filtering.
With 5 Mbits TCAM Memory, OC-192 line rate is achieved.
TCP attack detection is the priority as most internet traffic is TCP.
Matches the five tuples of {\textless}SIP, DIP, SPN, DPN, PRO{\textgreater}
Defines 2D matching as the feature of an outbound flow having a corresponding inbound flow in the opposite direction 
Flows without this feature are called unmatched flows. This will be used to detect anomalies with the assumption of IP spoofing which leads to unmatched flows. Unmatched flows may be caused too, due to servers being down or IP changes in servers, where the old IP is still cached in DNS.
This approach tries to be a functional TCAM switch with both policy filtering and DDoS detection capabilities. This adds extra complexity due to the local CPU having to differentiate between policy filtering and flow identity rules. Furthermore extra TCAM memory is needed and additional state management is needed. To achieve 2D matching indexing rules for the entries in the flow table are set and for each new flow an entry for the expected flow in the opposite direction is added
A local CPU keeps track of the states of flows in the TCAM coprocessor.
It is shown that a 100MHz Processor can handle fine the forwarding and rule updates
Small flow tables take a lot more time to detect anomalies but dont generate many false alarms. The bigger the table the faster the detection is and the more false alarms they are until a certain point when the table is big enough to not have overflows. Then the detection time is reduced as well as the false alarm rate.
In comparison to HollywooDDoS, this approach has all problems mentioned in its paper regarding flow based approaches. The latency and detection performance is limited by the table’s size.
This approach doesn’t have the ability to analyze developing attack patterns and struggles with low-rate targeted TCP DoS attacks. Every flow has to be monitored to have a conclusion.

The address range will be zoomed in into a higher granularity to be analyzed further this used for victim detection but can also be utilized to detect attackers.
The classification method uses packet and byte quantity and asymmetry as features. SOM an unsupervised AI is used a classifier.
The work uses a so called “attacker detection procedure“ to install openflow rules that drop packets from the attacker to the victim.
The IP address range of the system is covered by having a set of IP source prefixes and IP destination prefixes that are then used for every match combination. These matches are then installed as flows.
Sequential method (first victim then attack detection):
A classification of IP ranges is being constantly done for victim detection. If there is a positive result, the IP range is divided into a finer granularity, otherwise, if the range has a positive result and has been divided before, the division will be reversed/merged so that more TCAM space is available for adding granularity for potential victims. If a range is divided until the lowest granularity is reached, attack detection will begin.
Attack detection works the same, but it uses a classifier tuned for attackers.
When both attacker and victim granularities are at their lowest, the concrete IP source and destination IP addresses will be returned.
Concurrent method (victim and attack detection simultaneously):
We begin with coarse granularity and if an IP range is suspected as victim, the attack detection is begun simultaneously. Ranges are split if they are suspected to be victims or attackers. Split addresses are merged if they and their siblings yield negative results.
Performance:
For victim detection. The sequential method is always a good choice, specially with low TCAM space. For attacker detection, the concurrent method can yield too coarse results when TCAM space is insufficient, otherwise, it is the preferred method.
