-- This file is now deprecated in favor of pgroll migrations
-- All schema changes are managed through migrations in the migrations/ directory

-- To initialize the database, use pgroll migrations:
--   docker compose up -d
-- Or manually:
--   ./scripts/migrate.sh

-- For reference, the initial schema is defined in: migrations/01_initial_schema.json

-- DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE
-- Create new migrations using: ./scripts/new_migration.sh <migration_name>
