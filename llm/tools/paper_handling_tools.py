This module implements the main tools for paper ingestion, filtering, storage, and project management.

Responsibilities:
- Fetching and updating papers for projects from OpenAlex
- Storing and linking papers to projects in the database
- Generating and storing paper embeddings in ChromaDB
- Filtering papers by natural language or user-defined criteria
- Generating relevance summaries for recommendations
- Handling paper replacement, multi-step reasoning, and query reformulation
- Utility functions for normalization, filtering, and paper metadata

All tools are designed to be modular and reusable by the Stategraph agent and other orchestration flows.

    """
    Tool Name: update_papers
    Description:
        This tool updates the paper database with the latest research papers and their embeddings
        based on a list of search queries. It performs the following steps:
        1. Fetches new papers using the provided list of queries.
        2. Stores the fetched papers in a PostgreSQL database, removing any duplicates.
        3. Stores the project's query so that it can be reused in the future
        4. Computes and stores embeddings for the newly stored papers.
    Use Case:
        Use this tool when you want to refresh the paper database with the latest research and ensure
        that all relevant papers have updated embeddings for ranking or similarity comparison tasks.
    Input:
        queries (list[str]): A list of *distinct, focused search queries* corresponding to the user's interests.
        When creating these queries:

        1. Each query should represent **one meaningful research topic, domain, or concept**.

        2. Avoid combining unrelated or loosely related topics into a single query.
        For example, do **not** use:
            "algorithmic pricing Gaussian Process Bandits"
        Instead, split into:
            "algorithmic pricing"
            "Gaussian Process Bandits"

        3. Keep **multi-word expressions intact** when they form a single concept (e.g., "Bayesian optimization",
        "Gaussian Process", "Bertrand markets").

        4. Prioritize clarity and focus over quantity — a smaller set of clean queries works better than many mixed queries.

        Examples:
            - User: "I'm interested in machine learning and neural networks"
              Good queries:
                ["machine learning", "neural networks"]

            - User: "I like ice cream and computer vision"
              Good queries:
                ["ice cream", "computer vision"]
              Bad queries:
                ["ice", "cream", "computer", "vision"]

            - User: "I'm interested in papers on algorithmic pricing using Gaussian Process Bandits,
                     including Bayesian optimization in Bertrand markets, the impact of acquisition functions
                     (e.g., GP-UCB, GP-EI), the role of GP kernels and hyperparameters in shaping market outcomes,
                     and memory loss strategies for computational efficiency."
              Good queries:
                ["algorithmic pricing",
                 "Gaussian Process Bandits",
                 "Bayesian optimization",
                 "Bertrand markets",
                 "GP-UCB",
                 "GP-EI",
                 "Gaussian Process kernels",

    If the query is valid, extract a list of 2-5 concise, domain-relevant keyword phrases (each 2-4 words) that best capture the research intent.

    Guidelines for keyword extraction:
    - Prefer multi-word, context-rich phrases over single words, but keep each phrase concise (2-4 words).
    - Avoid full sentences or overly detailed descriptions.
    - Do NOT repeat the same context in every keyword (e.g., don't add "in digital health" to every phrase).
    - Avoid generic or overly broad terms (e.g., "deep learning", "artificial intelligence", "healthcare").
    - Do NOT simply list synonyms or related fields.
    - Each keyword should be a phrase that could be used as a precise search query for this specific research interest.
    - Focus on specificity and informativeness, not quantity.

    Given the following research query, extract 2-5 highly relevant, expressive academic keyword phrases (each 2-4 words) that would maximize the quality of a literature search. Avoid generic terms, full sentences, and focus on specificity.

    You are a filtering assistant.

    Translate the user's request into a JSON **object** using ONLY the metric

    Allowed metric names:

    • publication_date

    • cited_by_count
    • counts_by_year

    Schema per entry:
    "<metric>": {{"op": "<operator>", "value": <number|string|list>}}

    Guidelines for similarity_score (normalized 0-1 scale):
    - Only add a similarity_score filter if the user explicitly specifies a similarity threshold (e.g., "similarity above 0.7", "similarity >= 0.8").
    - If the user just says "papers similar to this" or "find similar papers" without a number, do NOT add a similarity_score filter.
